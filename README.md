# Quadratic_MLPs_in_RL
TD3 and SAC algorithms with Quadratic - MLP (Q-MLP) as  actor policy network 

Source code and data for our accompanying paper "A  Quadratic  Actor  Network  for  Model-Free  Reinforcement  Learning"

To run the test - with hyperparameter settings of the paper - run teh shell scripts in the SAC and TD3 folder, respectively.

./run_td3_nohup.sh

./run_sac_nohup.sh
